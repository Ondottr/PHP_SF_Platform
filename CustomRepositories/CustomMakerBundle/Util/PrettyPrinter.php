     * with just 1 space. By changing 1 indent to 4, we effectively
     * "correct" this problem when printing.

     * from 1 space to 4) and already (without needing any other
     * changes) adds 4 spaces onto that. This is why we don't
     * also need to handle indent levels of 5, 9, etc: these
     * do not occur (at least in the code we generate);
